                uh... been a minute. sorry about that<br>
                i didnt date the last log but im writing this 10/8/25. and its been a few months<br><br>
                
                i have made progress. but not much. i moved, then started school, got lazy for a bit, and now im unlazy but i got recruited to programming two other games. maybe that made me unlazy, idk<br>
                but regardless cou will be put on the backburner. ill still be drawing and planning, letting ideas age in my head. maybe ill have a good story by the time development resumes more seriously<br><br>
                
                <iframe loading="lazy" src="https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1964911797657555278&amp;origin=neocities.org&amp;theme=light&amp;width=550px" style="height:517px;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br>
                sorry about the cruddy embed<br>
                the way the game looks hasnt really changed since this was posted<br>
                you may notice... it isnt 3d. i made the 3d model because i dont like animating and animating a 3d model seemed like less work than drawing a million poses, but then i realized i hate animating a 3d model way more than drawing a million poses<br>
                her sprites definitely arent final but the animation will probably stay choppy til release. just pretend its stylistic<br><br>
                
                did someone say drawing?<br>
                ive had a lot of fun drawing lately. i started using a pen instead of a pencil and for some reason that made it 100x more enjoyable. heres some random cou sketches. spoilers?<br>
                <img src="sketch1.png" title="a utilitist"><img src="sketch2.png" title="a criminal"><img src="sketch3.png" title="a freak"><img src="sketch4.png" title="a scientist"><img src="sketch5.png" title="laurcey"><br>
                as a result of drawing a lot im realizing how embarassingly bad at drawing i was and still am. but that means im getting better i think!<br>
                i scroll down to the stupid laurcey drawings lower and im like grah the head way to big. as a now artist i realize these things<br><br>
                
                nothing has changed gameplay wise, i just have more ideas<br>
                itll be like megaman where you have a bunch of areas you can pick to go between. then theres a big final area you go to at the end<br>
                i have less ideas than id like for the areas, but what i have is just enough for a good sized game as long as i squeeze them for all their worth. hopefully ill get more though<br><br>
                
                thats about all i have that i wanna say. see you in a million years

            <div class="box">
                first devlog for (working title) CLUB OF UTILITY ft laurcey junction<br><br>
                
                a lots still in planning but ill have some fun visual stuff for ya through this<br>
                the briefest way i can describe it (or what it will be) is a sidescrolling soulslike roguelike, thats not me being like "i like all of these game genres so i wil lcombine them and it will be EPIC!" i think theyll all work together well<br>
                the sidescrolling combat is 2d, you can hit the top, middle, or bottom lanes and block or duck down to dodge. theyres also rolling and parrying (so maybe more plike than soulslike?). its like the combat arena x part of daniel mullins the hex but expanded on a lot. when you kill bad guys they drop their weapon and you collect their soul, souls have a positive and a negative effect and weapons have different arrangements of slots for souls<br>
                for example, one sword might have two slots for passive and one slot for attack. if you have a soul with the effects "deal 2x damage, take 2x damage" itd be smarter to put that in the attack slot than the passive slot, since the passive effects are always going youd be vulnerable more of time. most of the time it wont be that black and white though<br><br>
                
                not gameplay related stuff now. i will try to put effort into writing an interesting story for the game<br>
                for philip i had some ideas but ended up not using any because the game didnt have enough content to be broken up by cutscenes (and i had trouble making a good cutscene engine)<br>
                i could imagine having a couple cutscenes but most of itd be dialog, with friendly/neutral npcs and bosses while youre killing them<br>
                i also think voice acting could be cool, but im unsure wether id know enough people competent to voice act by the time that part of the game is ready. i might meet a lot through college though, and i wont be finished with this game before im shipped off there so theres hope<br>
                music. argh music. about the last artistic thing ive always wanted to be competent with but never put in any effort<br>
                i like what was made for philip but it cost way too much for what i got, scaling that up to the content thatll be in cou (short for club of utility. moooo) would be more than id be willing to part with for a game im making for free<br>
                this is another thing i hope ill find someone from college willing to be paid by a name credit. or maybe my tgirl friendll finally pick up flstudio like she was always meant to<br><br>
                
                onto those images i promised<br>
                <img src="sketches.png"><img src="jealous.png" title="jealous?"><img src="YOUDUDE.png" style="height:500px"><br>
                laurcey is from the darksouls ttrpg game my formerly mentioned friend ran and i decided to reuse her for no reason<br>
                that big dreamcatcher thing on her back is what collects the souls, it comes from a cult that was inherited by a guy who doesnt care at all for what it was meant to stand for and is only using it to try to recruit girls for a harem. i want to make him really lame and hateable so hes worth being a secret boss<br>
                the final game will be 2.5d because after drawing a few sprites for her i realized i dont want to have to do the same thing for the couple dozen characters thatll end up in the game<br>
                the image of the model doesnt have textures yet because i dont like doing that part, she wont stay smooth like that forever<br>
                <img src="inventory.png"><br>
                i also have this concept image of the inventory menu, the souls part on the left can be swapped out for a resident evil inventory for all your weapons (because i just cant stop stealing from other games!)<br>
                the <img src="/ghost.gif" style="display:inline-block; height:1em" title="little warlmoro"> button banishes the soul from the weapon, once a soul is put in a slot you cant use it anywhere else
