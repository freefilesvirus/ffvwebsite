                me first gamejam since the philip demo came out. its been a minute!<br>
                also whoahey, my music debut. isnt it sound so good? i was told it sounds like a bog in a zelda game, i think thats good<br><br>
                
                anyways. DAVEY vs THE BIG GUY was made for godot wild jam 84, under the theme critters. the game is about nailing quick time events to stack crits which increase your damage exponentially, its kind of a stretch for the theme but i had fun<br>
                (obviously) themed around david vs goliath but i dont know anything about that story other than david small goliath big, and small david kills big goliath with a sling, and i dont particularly care to make it accurate anyways<br><br>
                
                uh theres a soulslite (i was told its not a like) controller, 3 different kinds of qtes, the worst ranged weapon ever made for a video game. what am i meant to talk about here again?<br>
                i learned a lot from the philip jam but not really anything from this. i think thats a good thing, im getting better at this stuff plus it was fun. maybe get more eyes on me too! theres always hoping, and maybe ill start doing more jams cause i forgot how fun this is<br>
                i started a few days into the jam and submitted a few days before it was over. more couldve been added, but i dont particularly want to keep workin on it. i forgot how useful the end date was for motivation, cou has been sitting around for like a month and making a pretty well rounded game in less than a week kinda makes me wanna lock in and start putting down due dates for myself<br><br>
                
                no visual material this time sorry. there wasnt any concept art, all i have in my planning notes is "trying to get crits w/ weapons" "david vs goliath" and "soulslike", everything else was made as needed<br><br>
                
                kinda related kinda pissed I MISSED THIS YEARS GMTK! i was gonna do somethin for that but i didnt look at the start and end date before moving across the country and it happened to align poorly that my computer was in a car when it started and not set up when it ended. oh well. 2026ll be my year?<br><br>
